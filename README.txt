Smash TV
========

To build a new rom, you'll need to have CC65 installed.
On linux you should be able to get that from a package manager, on windows you'll want to install Windows Subsystem for Linux:

And then from a bash terminal, write:
`sudo apt install cc65 make`

Then in the root folder of the project, write:
`make`

And you should get an 'entry.sfc' file that will start the japanese release of Smash TV!
